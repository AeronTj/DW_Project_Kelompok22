## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our data warehouse system seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 🔒 How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@ptxyz.com] (replace with actual email)
2. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### 📋 What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., SQL injection, authentication bypass)
- **Location** (file path, function name, URL)
- **Potential impact** (data exposure, privilege escalation)
- **Proof of concept** (code, screenshots)
- **Environment details** (Docker version, OS, etc.)

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: Within 72 hours
  - High: Within 1 week
  - Medium: Within 2 weeks
  - Low: Next release cycle

### 🛡️ Security Measures

This project implements several security measures:

#### Database Security
- SQL Server authentication with strong passwords
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Database access restricted to application services
- Regular security updates

#### Container Security
- Images from trusted registries
- Non-root user execution where possible
- Network isolation between services
- Health checks and monitoring

#### Application Security
- Environment variable configuration
- No hardcoded credentials in code
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling without information disclosure

#### Access Control
- Default dashboard authentication
- Role-based access where applicable
- Secure default configurations
- Regular password rotation recommendations

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**: All changes require review
2. **Dependency Updates**: Regularly update dependencies
3. **Secret Management**: Use environment variables
4. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
5. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information

### For Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit secrets
2. **Network Security**: Use Docker networks
3. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication
4. **Monitoring**: Set up security monitoring
5. **Backup Security**: Secure backup procedures

### Configuration Security

```bash
# Example secure .env configuration
MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=Str0ng!P@ssw0rd123
SUPERSET_SECRET_KEY=complex-random-key-here
JUPYTER_TOKEN=secure-random-token

# Network isolation
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=ptxyz-dw-secure
```

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Default Passwords**: Project uses default passwords for demo
2. **HTTP Only**: No SSL/TLS configuration included
3. **Local Network**: Designed for local development
4. **Sample Data**: Contains synthetic data only

### Production Recommendations

1. **Change All Passwords**: Use unique, strong passwords
2. **Enable SSL/TLS**: Configure HTTPS for all services
3. **Network Security**: Implement proper firewall rules
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep all components updated
5. **Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring
6. **Backup Encryption**: Encrypt all backups

## 🛠️ Security Tools

### Recommended Security Tools

1. **Container Scanning**: 
   ```bash
   docker scan your-image:tag
   ```

2. **Dependency Checking**:
   ```bash
   pip-audit
   safety check
   ```

3. **Code Analysis**:
   ```bash
   bandit -r .
   ```

4. **Network Monitoring**:
   - Container network isolation
   - Service discovery security

### Security Testing

```bash
# Test authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/login

# Test authorization
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer token" http://localhost:8088/api/

# Test input validation
python security_tests.py
```

## 📋 Compliance

### Data Protection

- **GDPR Compliance**: Consider data protection requirements
- **Data Retention**: Implement appropriate retention policies
- **Data Anonymization**: Use synthetic data for development
- **Access Logging**: Log all data access activities

### Industry Standards

- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **SOC 2**: Security and availability
- **OWASP Top 10**: Web application security

## 🚀 Incident Response
